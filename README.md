# Multifractals

(I have some code for analysing spatial data for multifractality, and I'd like to make a Github release for it ... but it's going to take a while to get into the Github way of doing things ... in particular, the idea of test-driven development is new to me, as is the documentation system.

Plus there is functionality that really should be there ... I just use Renyi dimensions, but there is also the equivalent multifractal spectrum and some other concepts. In fact, the nomenclature is not entirely settled, so it should probably get some detail here.)
